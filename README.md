# Ta-Da - Mim1q's Datagen Toolkit

A utility Kotlin library for generating data for your Minecraft mods and datapacks

## Premise

This project started as a personal tool that eases the creation of models, blockstates and other files used in my 
Minecraft mods.  
It aims to help you create these files in a more imperative and intuitive manner.

## Q&A

- **How can I use the library in my own projects?**  
  TBD

## Possible future additions

- Language file utilities
- Color switcher based on user-defined swatches
